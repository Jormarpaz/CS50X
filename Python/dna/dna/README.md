# DNA Project

## Overview

The DNA project is designed to help you understand how to work with DNA sequences using Python. The project involves writing a program that identifies a person based on their DNA sequence by comparing it to a database of known sequences.

## Features

- **DNA Sequence Analysis:** Reads DNA sequences from a file and analyzes them.
- **Database Comparison:** Compares the DNA sequence to a database of known individuals to find a match.
- **Output Results:** Outputs the name of the individual whose DNA matches the sequence.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dna.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd dna
    ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

To use the DNA project, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Database and Sequence Files:**
    - Ensure you have a CSV file containing the DNA database.
    - Ensure you have a text file containing the DNA sequence to be analyzed.

2. **Run the Program:**

    ```sh
    python dna.py database.csv sequence.txt
    ```

    Replace `database.csv` with the path to your database file and `sequence.txt` with the path to your DNA sequence file.

3. **View the Results:**
    - The program will output the name of the individual whose DNA matches the sequence.
