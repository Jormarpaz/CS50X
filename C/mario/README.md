# CS50X Week Projects

## Overview

This week, we have two main projects to work on. Below are the details of each project, including their names and instructions on how to use them.

## Projects

### 1. Mario (Less)

**Description:** This project involves creating a simple pyramid using hashes (`#`) similar to the pyramids in the Mario game.

**Usage:**

1. Compile the program using:

    ```sh
    make mario
    ```

2. Run the program:

    ```sh
    ./mario
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the height of the pyramid.

### 2. Mario (More)

**Description:** This project is an extension of the Mario (Less) project, where you create a more complex pyramid with two adjacent pyramids.

**Usage:**

1. Compile the program using:

    ```sh
    make mario
    ```

2. Run the program:

    ```sh
    ./mario
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the height of the pyramids.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the CS50 library installed to compile and run the programs.
- Both projects are designed to help you practice loops and conditionals in C.

Happy coding!
