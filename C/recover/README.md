# CS50X Week Projects

This week, we have two main projects to work on. Below are the details of each project, their names, and how to use them.

## Projects

### 1. Recover

**Description:**
The `recover` project involves writing a program in C that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image. The program reads a forensic image and extracts JPEG files from it.

**Usage:**
To use the `recover` program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the program using `make`:

    ```sh
    make recover
    ```

2. Run the program with the forensic image file as an argument:

    ```sh
    ./recover IMAGE
    ```

    Replace `IMAGE` with the name of the forensic image file you want to recover JPEGs from.

## Additional Information
