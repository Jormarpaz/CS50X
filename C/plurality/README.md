# CS50X Week Projects

This week, we are focusing on several projects that will help you understand the basics of C programming, particularly in the context of voting systems. Below are the projects and instructions on how to use them.

## Projects

### 1. Plurality

**Plurality** is a program that simulates a plurality voting system, where each voter can vote for one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.

#### How to Use

1. **Compile the Program**:

    ```sh
    make plurality
    ```

2. **Run the Program**:

    ```sh
    ./plurality [candidate1] [candidate2] ... [candidateN]
    ```

    Replace `[candidate1]`, `[candidate2]`, ..., `[candidateN]` with the names of the candidates.

3. **Input the Number of Voters**:

    The program will prompt you to enter the number of voters.

4. **Cast Votes**:

    Each voter will be prompted to enter their vote by typing the name of their chosen candidate.

5. **View the Winner**:

    After all votes have been cast, the program will display the name of the winning candidate(s).

### 2. Other Projects

Details about other projects will be added here as they are developed.

## General Instructions

1. **Ensure You Have CS50 Library Installed**:

    The programs use the CS50 library, so make sure you have it installed.

2. **Compile the Programs**:

    Use the `make` command to compile the programs.

3. **Run the Programs**:

    Follow the specific instructions for each program to run them and interact with them.

4. **Understand the Code**:

    Take time to read and understand the code provided. This will help you learn the concepts being taught.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance with the projects. Happy coding!
