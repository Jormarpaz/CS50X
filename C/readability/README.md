# CS50X Week Projects

## Overview

This week, we focus on enhancing our understanding of text processing and readability analysis. The projects are designed to help you practice working with strings, loops, and conditional statements in C.

## Projects

### 1. Readability

The `readability` project involves writing a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text. The program uses the Coleman-Liau index to determine the readability score.

#### How to Use

1. **Compile the Program:**

    ```sh
    make readability
    ```

2. **Run the Program:**

    ```sh
    ./readability
    ```

3. **Input Text:**
    Enter the text you want to analyze when prompted.

4. **Output:**
    The program will output the grade level required to understand the input text.

### 2. Other Projects

Details about other projects will be added here as they are completed.

## Conclusion

These projects are designed to help you get comfortable with text processing in C. Make sure to test your programs thoroughly and understand the logic behind the Coleman-Liau index for the readability project.

Happy coding!
